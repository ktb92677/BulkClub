If you ask any standard computer scientist they will tell you that
public variables in classes are bad. Why is this? It's because 
this is what you've been fed by your teachers, and your teachers 
were fed this by their teachers and so on. Public variables in 
classes are declared bad for two reasons:

1. Unprotected variables.
2. Breaks OOP. (object oriented programming)

To address number 1, public variables are inherently unprotected,
that's just what they are. (hence why they are not called private)
If you find yourself in a situation where you don't want to protect
a variable then what reason is there to protect it? That logic is
backwards.

To address number 2, OOP is the concept of adding a layer of
arbitration over a class as to protect its exact implementation.
The normal way around this is to set a variable private and creating
get/set methods for the variable. THIS BREAKS OOP YOU MORONS. By
creating get/set methods you are just crowding your class with
unnecessary functions, decreasing readability, decreasing 
efficency, increasing amount of code that needs to be written 
and you are revealing implementation thus breaking OOP.

Public variables in classes are more than fine.
